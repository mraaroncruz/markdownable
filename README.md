# Markdownable

Adds an attribute to your class that is a markdown representation of another attribute.
Includes auto-include for ActiveRecord

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'markdownable'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install markdownable

## Usage
With a Plain Old Ruby ObjectÂ®
    require 'markdownable'

    class Article
      include Markdownable
      attr_accessor :title, :author, :body
      markdownable :body
    end

    article = Article.new
    article.body = "## Hello world"
    # adds a `_markdown` field to any fields you chose above
    puts article.body_markdown #=> "<h2>Hello world</h2>"

With ActiveRecord you don't need to include the module

    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      markdownable :text
    end

    article = Article.new(:body => "## Hello World")
    article.save
    # adds a `_markdown` field to any fields you chose above
    puts article.text_markdown #=> "<h2>Hello world</h2>"
